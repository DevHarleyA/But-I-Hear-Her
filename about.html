					<h1>About the Project</h1>
					<p>
						But I Hear Her began when project co-curator Hannah Trivilino encountered an intriguing
						glitch in a vinyl record she listened to at the start of the Covid-19 lockdown. While listening
						to her grandparents records, Trivilino found that a scratch on a 45 titled “Teddy Bear” (by
						Red Sovine) produced a loop that repeated the phrase,

					<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
						"and sometimes we were crying / sometimes we were crying / sometimes we were crying.“
					</blockquote>

					Curious about the original context for this recitation, Trivilino looked up the song’s lyrics
					only to find it never actually says, “sometimes we were crying.” Instead, the lyrics—while
					describing a boy’s widowed mother read:

					<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
						“she says not to worry /
						that we’ll make it alright /
						but I hear her cryin’ /
						sometimes late at night.”
					</blockquote>


					Inspired by the ways the record scratch inadvertently transformed a moment of maternal isolation
					and struggle into a chorus of collective pain (and, therefore, collective care through
					solidarity), Trivilino wondered what it might be like to create a praxis of this transformation
					via artistic translation. To do this, she and But I Hear Her co-curators Christa Oliver-Torres,
					Swati Kshami Rani, Vassiliki Rapti, and Betsy Salerno recorded audio accounts of their
					communities’ experiences practicing mothering and/or other forms of caretaking devalued by
					systems of patriarchy during the Covid-19 pandemic. This collection of numerous and multilingual
					audio stories from a wide range of voices and perspectives play overtop each other to create a
					collective chorus and individually to bear witness to the stories that may otherwise be lost to
					an isolated ‘crying late at night’ realm.</p>
					<p>
						As the Teddy Bear lyrics share the story of hidden tears shed in isolation, But I Hear Her asks:
						how do we create futures where such tears can be held by community? How do we grow a culture
						that—like the scratched Teddy Bear record—transforms “but I hear her cryin’ / sometimes late at
						night” into “sometimes we were crying,” a collective cry? How do we foreground care? —shift “but
						I hear her cryin’ / sometimes late at night” into “...but I hear her.”
					</p>
					<p>
						We see one path towards this future as coming from creating space for mothers and caretakers to
						share their experiences so they do not have to process experiences privately. We also believe in
						the importance of parents listening to their children as one of many ways to cultivate humans
						who are oriented towards care. Believing that children naturally posture themselves toward care
						(and only become distanced from these practices when socially constructed harshnesses—structural
						oppressions, colonizations, exploitations, greed, dominations, etc—disincentivize caretaking),
						we propose that nurturing children's imaginations and validating children’s creativities offers
						an antidote to potential future behaviors of carelessness/harm.
					</p>
					<p>
						To center children’s creativities, But I Hear Her features a series of video pieces created by
						mothers in collaboration with their daughters. Inspired by But I Hear Her co-curator Vassiliki
						Rapti’s A Child’s Resistance project, in which Rapti wrote a series of poems responding to
						prompts given to Rapti by her daughter Katerina Triantafyllou, But I Hear Her co-curators
						Christa Oliver-Torres and Swati Kshama Rani additionally co-created artistic pieces with their
						daughters Eliana Torres and Asha Kshama Mehta.
					</p>
					<p>
						Christa and Eliana perform a dance titled Rooted In Love, which they choreographed together
						(filmed by Ana Baer Carrillo). Christa and Eliana additionally share a video of the two of them
						dancing in their living room to inspire other parents and children to create moments to dance
						with each other. Swati and Asha’s piece, Witnessing Through Water and Play, uses water to
						connect ancestors, Mother Earth, and Asha’s play to study of the pandemic. Witnessing Through
						Water and Play is themed around Swati and Asha’s five nodes of creativity: connecting, playing,
						problem solving, witnessing, and learning. Vassiliki and Katerina read A Child’s Resistance in
						English and Greek over a collection of photos and artwork created by the women of Vassiliki’s
						family. Vassiliki additionally shares poems she wrote about her own mother. But I Hear Her
						features these practices of mothers creating from a place inspired by their children to center
						the dual importance of both listening to the experiences of mothers and designing a world
						imagined by children when dreaming healthier futures.
					</p>
					<p>
						But I Hear Her’s mother/daughter collaboration videos and audio stories are housed in a shrine
						designed by women’s mythology/spirituality educator and But I Hear Her co-curator Betsy Salerno.
						This shrine is inspired by Salerno’s research on the spiritual, historical, cultural, and
						political significances of Our Lady of Guadalupe and Black Madonnas. To visualize But I Hear
						Her’s video pieces, Betsy designed areas surrounding each video based on the elements earth,
						air, fire, and water. The shrine additionally features an altar area where exhibition attendees
						can pay tribute to loved ones lost to Covid-19 and/or lost in the Covid-19 era.
					</p>
					<p>
						Those who visit the But I Hear Her can take in the project’s shrine; listen to the audio chorus
						of stories; witness But I Hear Her’s mother/daughter collaboration videos; visit with and
						contribute to the altar honoring those lost during the Covid era; learn ways to collaborate
						creatively with children; and more. Audiences are additionally invited to add to But I Hear Her
						by sharing their own stories to the installation; through continued integration of additional
						stories, But I Hear Her evolves and revolves as a living archive of motherhood/caretaking during
						the Covid-19 pandemic and as a blueprint for life giving futures born from children’s
						imaginaries.
