					<h1>Share Your Story</h1>
					<p class="lead"><span class="fst-italic">But I Hear Her </span>features stories of people’s experiences practicing mothering and / or caretaking in the Covid-19 pandemic, and we would love to hear yours!</p>
					<ul class="list-unstyled">
						<li>This story sharing can take many forms, including but not limited to:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Offering a general overview of overall experience caretaking amid Covid-19</li>
							<li>Sharing a specific story</li>
							<li>Describing what you’ve witnessed of mother(s)/caretaker(s) you know</li>
							<li>Recording a dialogue between yourself and another person / group of people</li>
							<li>Any other form that feels good to you!</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p class="fw-bold">Preparing your storytelling:</p>
					<p>We invite you to tell your story in whatever way feels authentic to you! Because of that, we do not have any specific format that we ask you to follow.</p>
					<ul class="list-unstyled">
						<li>If you would like help getting started with your story, we recommend reflecting on the following prompts:</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fst-italic">What has been challenging? </li>
							<li class="fst-italic">What has been special?</li>
							<li class="fst-italic">How has parenting/caretaking been different for you during Covid-19 compared to how it was prior? </li>
							<li class="fst-italic">Was there a moment where it all felt like too much?</li>
							<li class="fst-italic">Was there a moment where you felt supported/held?</li>
							<li class="fst-italic">What does/would support look like for you?</li>
							<li class="fst-italic">What advice do you have for mothers / caretakers?</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>If you would like to begin your story with any identifying information (such as your name, salient identities, geographic location, etc) we welcome you to do so! We also welcome you keeping yourself anonymous if that is what you prefer!</p>
					<p>While the project was inspired by the <span class="fst-italic">“sometimes we were crying” </span>recitation (see <span class="fw-bold"><a href="about.html">"About"</a></span>), we do not only seek stories of sadness/grief/pain; we embrace all stories of caretaking during Covid-19 and see the shift to <span class="fst-italic">“sometimes we were crying” </span>as a call to create avenues that listen to mothers and caretakers and offer space process their experiences.</p>
					<p class="fw-bold">How to record your story:</p>
					<p>If you have a smart phone or computer, we recommend recording yourself with the voice memo feature or a voice recording app.</p>
					<p>If you do not have a smart phone/computer and/or prefer not to record that way, our team would be happy to record you over the phone or in person if we are in the same area. To coordinate a time to call a But I Hear Her team member, please email <span class="text-primary">butihearher@gmail.com</span></p>
					<p class="fw-bold">How to send your story file:</p>
					<p>When you have finished recording, please email your file to <span class="text-primary">butihearher@gmail.com</span> Depending on the file size, you may need to send your file through dropbox, google drive, or another means. If you have questions about sending your file please email <span class="text-primary">butihearher@gmail.com</span>.
					</p>
					<p>We will include your story in <span class="fst-italic">But I Hear Her's </span>audio constellation of stories. This includes a chorus of stories, where all the stories play at the same time, and a playlist of stories, where all the stories play individually (for more information about this, see <span class="fw-bold"><a href="about.html">"About"</a></span>) <span class="fst-italic"> **if you would like your story to appear only in the chorus or playlist but not both, please indicate this when you email your audio file. Thank you!**</span></p>
					<p class="fw-bold">Additional Notes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you would like to share a story but do not want your voice to be included, we are happy to have one of our team members read your story for you.</li>
						<li>We welcome stories in all languages!</li>
						<li>If you have time / ability, we appreciate if you can provide us with a written transcription of your audio (we like to offer captions with our audio stories to make them more accessible to a wider range of audience members). Thanks! :)</li>
